README.md
This Foder has 3 implementation files with name as below:
1) Data Preprocessing - Preprocessing of dataset to make analysis. Steps like data manipulation, data cleaning, data transformation are                           ,data imputation are involved.

2) Random Forest - To select best and important features out of list of feature from dataset we have applied Feature Importance technique                    using RandomForestRegressor. Obtained important features are utilized in the modeling.

3) Regression -  This file of code contains the modeling technique Linear Regression that we have applied to check correlation of                          extracted features by analysing performance metrics of the model.

#Order to follow to implement:
Data Preprocessing -> Random Forest -> Regression
